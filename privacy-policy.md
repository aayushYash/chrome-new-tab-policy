# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: [April 9, 2025]_

This Chrome extension, **Custom Chrome New Tab**, respects your privacy. We do **not** collect or share any personally identifiable information.

---

## What We Collect

- The extension uses `chrome.storage` to store your preferences such as theme, tasks, and settings **locally** on your device.
- It makes API calls to retrieve live weather data. These calls are made directly from your browser and are not logged or stored by us.

---

## Data Usage

- **No personal data** is collected, stored, or transmitted by this extension.
- All data remains on your device unless explicitly sent to a third-party service (e.g., weather API for forecasts).
- We do not use analytics, trackers, or ads of any kind.

---

## Permissions

- **Storage**: Used to remember your settings and to-do list.
- **Remote Code/API Access**: Only used to fetch real-time weather or similar data.
- **Host Permissions**: If used, it's solely to open links the user adds (not to access data on those sites).

---

## Third-Party Services

We may use external APIs such as:
- **OpenWeatherMap** (https://openweathermap.org) for weather information

These services have their own privacy policies. We do not control or store any data sent to or received from these APIs.
